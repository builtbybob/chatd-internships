# ChatD Internships Bot - TODO & Future Improvements

This document tracks planned improvements and enhancements for the ChatD Internships Discord bot.

## üöÄ Priority Items

### 1. Dynamic Log Level Control
**Goal**: Update logging levels on the fly without process restart

**Current Issue**: Changing log levels requires systemctl restart, causing service interruption

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] **1.1** Enhance signal handlers in `logging_utils.py`
  - [ ] Currently supports SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 for level changes
  - [ ] Add Docker-compatible signal sending via `docker exec`
  - [ ] Test: `docker exec chatd-bot python -c "import os, signal; os.kill(1, signal.SIGUSR1)"`
- [ ] **1.2** Add management command support
  - [ ] Extend `chatd` script with `chatd loglevel debug|info|warning|error`
  - [ ] Implementation: `sudo docker exec chatd-bot python -c "import signal, os; os.kill(1, signal.SIGUSR1)"`
- [ ] **1.3** Add REST API endpoint (optional)
  - [ ] Simple HTTP server for log level changes
  - [ ] Secure with basic auth or token
- [ ] **1.4** Document runtime log level control in README

**Files to modify**: `chatd/logging_utils.py`, `scripts/chatd`, `README.md`

### 2. Optimize Docker Build Performance ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Separate build and run phases to eliminate slow startup times

**Current Issue**: ~~`systemctl start` rebuilds Docker image every time (~30-60 seconds)~~ **RESOLVED**

**Implementation Plan**:
- [x] **2.1** Modify systemd service strategy
  - [x] Remove `ExecStartPre` Docker build step
  - [x] Create separate build workflow
- [x] **2.2** Add build management commands
  - [x] `chatd-build`: Manual rebuild trigger
  - [x] `chatd-deploy`: Deploy with existing image
  - [x] `chatd-update`: Build + restart in one command
- [ ] **2.3** Implement image versioning
  - [ ] Tag images with git commit hash: `chatd-internships:${GIT_COMMIT}`
  - [ ] Track current deployment version
- [ ] **2.4** Add CI/CD build hooks
  - [ ] GitHub Actions to build and push images
  - [ ] Local deployment pulls pre-built images
- [x] **2.5** Update systemd service file
  - [x] Remove build steps from service startup
  - [x] Add health checks for faster failure detection

**Results Achieved**:
- **Deployment time**: Reduced from ~4+ minutes to ~8 seconds
- **Build separation**: Can now build once, deploy multiple times
- **New commands**: `chatd build`, `chatd deploy`, `chatd update`
- **Faster iteration**: Quick deployments for testing and rollbacks

**Files modified**: `chatd-internships.service`, `scripts/create-management-scripts.sh`

### 3. Asynchronous Message Reactions

3. **Update configuration documentation** for any new settings
4. **Test in development environment** before production deployment
5. **Update README.md** with new features and configuration options

### Configuration Management

- Add validation for configuration values
- Document impact and recommended values
- Consider backward compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration tests**: Full workflow testing
- **Performance tests**: Benchmark improvements
- **Production validation**: Test with real data in controlled manner

### Deployment Considerations
- **Zero-downtime deployment** for non-breaking changes
- **Database migration strategy** for storage changes
- **Rollback procedures** for failed deployments
- **Monitoring and alerting** for new features

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### **Docker Build Performance Optimization** *(September 21, 2025)*
**Problem**: Slow deployments due to Docker rebuilding on every service restart
- `systemctl start` triggered full Docker rebuild (~4+ minutes)
- No separation between building images and deploying containers
- Made development iterations painfully slow

**Solution**: Separated build and deployment phases
- **Removed** Docker build from systemd service startup process
- **Added** dedicated management commands: `chatd build`, `chatd deploy`, `chatd update`
- **Optimized** deployment workflow for development speed

**Impact**: 
- [x] Deployment time reduced from ~4+ minutes to ~8 seconds
- [x] Build once, deploy multiple times capability
- [x] Faster iteration cycles for development and testing
- [x] Clear separation of concerns (build vs deploy)

**Files Modified**: `chatd-internships.service`, `scripts/create-management-scripts.sh`

### **Role Matching Logic Enhancement** *(September 21, 2025)*
**Problem**: Over-matching prevented detection of role re-openings
- Same company posting identical role titles resulted in missed notifications
- Bot couldn't distinguish between original posting and re-openings

**Solution**: Enhanced `normalize_role_key()` function
```python
# Before: company__title
# After:  company__title__date_posted
```

**Impact**: 
- [x] Role re-openings now properly detected and posted
- [x] Prevents duplicate notifications for minor data updates  
- [x] Maintains stable keys for legitimate role updates
- [x] Added comprehensive test coverage including re-opening scenarios

**Files Modified**: `chatd/repo.py`, `tests/test_repo.py`
