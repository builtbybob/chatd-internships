**Files modified**: `chatd-internships.service`, `scripts/create-management-scripts.sh`

### 3. Docker Image Auto-Pruning üßπ **(Quick Win - High Priority)**
**Goal**: Automatically clean up old Docker images to prevent disk space issues

**Current Issue**: Multiple Docker images accumulate (386MB each), consuming limited disk space
**Current State**: 3 images = ~1.1GB, only 505MB free space remaining

**Implementation Plan**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **3.1** Add auto-pruning to deployment workflow
  - [x] Modify `chatd-update` script to retain only N latest versions (default: 3)
  - [x] Keep current commit and 2 previous versions (N-1 and N-2 rollback capability)
  - [x] Automatic cleanup after successful deployment
  - [x] Configuration option for retention count: `DOCKER_IMAGE_RETENTION=3`
- [x] **3.2** Manual cleanup commands
  - [x] Add `chatd cleanup` command for manual image pruning
  - [x] Add `chatd images` command to list current images with sizes
  - [x] Add `chatd prune` command for aggressive cleanup (keep only latest)
  - [x] Dry-run mode: `chatd cleanup --dry-run` to preview what would be deleted
- [x] **3.3** Disk space monitoring integration
  - [x] Check available disk space before building new images
  - [x] Automatic emergency cleanup if disk usage > 90%
  - [x] Warning messages when approaching space limits
  - [x] Integration with future monitoring dashboard alerts

**Example Auto-Pruning Logic**:
```bash
# In chatd-update script, after successful deployment:
echo "üßπ Cleaning up old Docker images..."
RETENTION_COUNT=${DOCKER_IMAGE_RETENTION:-3}

echo "üìä Retention policy: keeping $RETENTION_COUNT images (current + 2 rollback options)"

# Get all chatd images sorted by creation date (newest first)
IMAGES=$(docker images chatd-internships --format "{{.Tag}}" | head -n +$RETENTION_COUNT)

# Remove images older than retention count
docker images chatd-internships --format "{{.Tag}}" | tail -n +$((RETENTION_COUNT + 1)) | while read tag; do
    if [[ "$tag" != "latest" ]]; then
        echo "üóëÔ∏è  Removing old image: chatd-internships:$tag"
        docker rmi "chatd-internships:$tag" 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
done

echo "‚úÖ Cleanup complete. Retained $RETENTION_COUNT images."
```

**New Management Commands**:
```bash
# Image management
sudo chatd images                    # List all ChatD images with sizes
sudo chatd cleanup                   # Clean up old images (keep 3)
sudo chatd cleanup --count 5         # Keep 5 images instead of 3
sudo chatd cleanup --dry-run         # Preview what would be deleted
sudo chatd prune                     # Aggressive cleanup (keep only latest)

# Disk space monitoring
sudo chatd disk                      # Show disk usage and image sizes
sudo chatd disk --alert              # Check if cleanup needed
```

**Disk Space Recovery**:
- **Current**: 3 images √ó 386MB = ~1.1GB used
- **After cleanup**: 3 images √ó 386MB = ~1.1GB (prevents growth beyond 3 images)
- **Emergency cleanup**: 1 image √ó 386MB = ~770MB total recovered

**Time to Implement**: ~30-45 minutes (high impact, low effort)

**Files to modify**:
- `scripts/create-management-scripts.sh` (add new cleanup commands)

**Results Achieved**:
- **Prevent disk space exhaustion** with current 7GB constraint
- **Automatic maintenance** - no manual intervention needed
- **Configurable retention** - balance between rollback capability and space
- **Emergency cleanup** - automatic recovery from space issues
- **Better visibility** - commands to monitor image usage

**Integration with Multi-Environment**:
- **Development**: Full test replay capabilities with message posting
- **Staging**: Controlled testing with limited Discord channels  
- **Production**: Read-only simulation mode (no actual messages sent)
- **Isolation**: Each environment has separate test data and repositories

**Benefits**:
- **Safe development testing** with realistic data scenarios
- **Automated test verification** of bot behavior changes
- **Performance benchmarking** during feature development
- **Regression testing** to ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Environment isolation** prevents test data from affecting production

**Files to create**:
- `scripts/setup-test-update-multi-env.sh` (enhanced multi-environment version)
- `scripts/test-scenarios/` (directory for predefined test cases)
- `scripts/test-verification.sh` (automated test result verification)

**Files to modify**:
- `setup_test_update.sh` (mark as deprecated, reference new script)

- Add validation for configuration values
- Document impact and recommended values
- Consider backward compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration tests**: Full workflow testing
- **Performance tests**: Benchmark improvements
- **Production validation**: Test with real data in controlled manner

### Deployment Considerations

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### **Dynamic Log Level Control** *(September 22, 2025)*
**Problem**: Log level changes required service restart, causing production downtime
- No way to debug production issues without interrupting service
- Debugging required stopping bot, changing config, and restarting
- Lost ability to investigate transient issues in real-time

**Solution**: Runtime log level control without restart
- **Added** `chatd-loglevel` command supporting all 5 log levels
- **Implemented** SIGHUP signal handler for instant level changes
- **Created** Docker-compatible file-based communication system
- **Simplified** implementation with clean, direct level setting

**Impact**:
- [x] **Instant debugging**: Change to DEBUG level without any service interruption
- [x] **Production troubleshooting**: Investigate live issues immediately
- [x] **Professional interface**: `sudo chatd-loglevel debug` provides immediate verbose logging
- [x] **Full control**: Support for debug/info/warning/error/critical levels
- [x] **Zero downtime**: Maintain service availability during troubleshooting

**Commands Available**:
```bash
sudo chatd-loglevel debug     # Maximum verbosity for troubleshooting
sudo chatd-loglevel info      # Normal operational messages  
sudo chatd-loglevel warning   # Warnings and errors only
sudo chatd-loglevel error     # Error conditions only
sudo chatd-loglevel critical  # Critical failures only
```

**Files Modified**: `chatd/logging_utils.py`, `scripts/create-management-scripts.sh`

### **Configurable Date Filtering** *(September 21, 2025)*
**Problem**: Hardcoded 5-day role filtering preventing flexible deployment configurations
- No way to adjust filtering without code changes
- Different environments might need different filtering windows
- Operational inflexibility for various use cases

**Solution**: Environment variable configuration with validation
- **Added** `MAX_POST_AGE_DAYS` environment variable (default: 5)
- **Implemented** 1-30 day range validation with helpful error messages
- **Enhanced** logging to show configured max age in debug output
- **Maintained** backward compatibility with existing behavior

**Impact**: 
- [x] Flexible role filtering based on deployment needs
- [x] Prevents spam from old bulk updates (configurable threshold)
- [x] No code changes required for operational adjustments
- [x] Clear validation prevents misconfiguration

**Files Modified**: `chatd/config.py`, `chatd/bot.py`, `.env.example`

### **Docker Build Performance Optimization** *(September 21, 2025)*
**Problem**: Slow deployments due to Docker rebuilding on every service restart
- `systemctl start` triggered full Docker rebuild (~4+ minutes)
- No separation between building images and deploying containers
- Made development iterations painfully slow

**Solution**: Separated build and deployment phases
- **Removed** Docker build from systemd service startup process
- **Added** dedicated management commands: `chatd build`, `chatd deploy`, `chatd update`
- **Optimized** deployment workflow for development speed

**Impact**: 
- [x] Deployment time reduced from ~4+ minutes to ~8 seconds
- [x] Build once, deploy multiple times capability
- [x] Faster iteration cycles for development and testing
- [x] Clear separation of concerns (build vs deploy)

**Files Modified**: `chatd-internships.service`, `scripts/create-management-scripts.sh`

### **ID-Based Role Tracking Implementation** *(September 24, 2025)*
**Problem**: Complex composite key matching system caused reliability issues
- Over-matching prevented detection of role re-openings
- Complex `get_role_id()` function with 28 lines of normalization logic
- Potential for matching ambiguity and missed notifications

**Solution**: Direct UUID-based tracking from listings.json
- **Migrated** from composite keys to direct `role['id']` access
- **Eliminated** complex `get_role_id()` and `normalize_role_key()` functions entirely
- **Implemented** comprehensive migration script for production data
- **Enhanced** management scripts with user-agnostic build process

**Impact**:
- [x] **100% reliable tracking**: Direct UUID access eliminates matching ambiguity
- [x] **Simplified codebase**: Removed 50+ lines of complex matching code  
- [x] **Production deployment**: Successfully migrated 319/325 messages (98.2% success)
- [x] **Future-proof architecture**: Scales with listings.json growth without complexity
- [x] **Enhanced tooling**: User-agnostic build system with CHATD_BRANCH support

**Migration Results**:
```
‚úÖ Production data migration completed
   ‚Ä¢ Messages migrated: 319/325 (98.2% success rate)
   ‚Ä¢ Backup created: message_tracking.json.backup.1758770169
   ‚Ä¢ 6 unmigrated messages: likely obsolete roles no longer in listings.json
```

**Files Modified**: `chatd/repo.py`, `chatd/bot.py`, `scripts/migrate-to-id-keys.py`, `scripts/create-management-scripts.sh`
